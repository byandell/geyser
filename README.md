Shiny Geyser App with and without Modules

This demonstrates how to take the
[Faithful Geyser Shiny example](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/faithful.html)
and modularize it, either by putting `ui()` and `server()` as functions in a
separate file from `app.R` or by using the Shiny module technology.
Sometimes the modular stuff is tricky to figure out.
For an overview, see the 
[slideDeck](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/slideDeck).

Go into one of the first four folders in
[inst/build_module](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/build_module)
and run the `app.R` file using `shiny::runApp()`.
To run the `quarto` versions, you will need to install
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and some packages; perhaps, see
[my quarto notes](https://github.com/byandell/quarto).

1. [oldFaithful](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/build_module/1_oldFaithful)
(original code in one file `app.R`)
2. [newFaithful](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/build_module/2_newFaithful)
(original code in "fake" functions)
3. [callModule](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/build_module/3_callModule)
(demo `callModule` vs `moduleServer`)
4. [moduleServer](https://github.com/byandell/geyser/tree/main/inst/build_module/4_moduleServer)
(full module approach using `moduleServer` and `NS` namespace)
